## Testing
This project is intented to be edited/ran with Godot Engine 4.6+

<sup> this is because of 4.6 ui changes and objects id changes </sup>

## Developing
- When contributing, please use [Godot 4.6 dev 4](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.6-dev4/) for the least LoC changes. (due to a lot of godot quirks)
